To remove unnessasary docker images

To check logs of the given container
-> docker logs {{Container-name}}

To move out particular folder or file from docker container to system 
-> To fulfill this type of requierment we have 2 options 

    1-> Manually
        In case we have to move only one file/folder from docker container to local system
        we can user docker cp command
        -> docker cp {{container_id}}:/path/of/file  /path/of/system/loc/{{filename}}

    2-> Automated
        In case we have to move all the file/folder that are generated into docker containter
        then we can build DockerFile and user volumes tag for the same
        -> volumes:
           - destination/path/of/system:source/path/of/docker/container
